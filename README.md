# Agricoltural commodity price prediction
The analysis of time series, i.e. datasets of measurements taken at regular time intervals, is a flourishing field of
research that has countless practical applications. In addition to
studying and identifying the components that influence the time
course of measured phenomena, time series are of particular
importance in the field of forecasting. The ability to generate
reliable future predictions is a key factor in the development of
many business and research activities, from weather forecasting
to hyper fast cryptocurrency trading. In this project, agricultural
commodity prices were studied and factors that might influence them were investigated. The purpose of the project is to
demonstrate the correlation between corn prices and rainfall data
measured in the growing areas. Moreover, forecasting techniques
that consider solely the past trend of the price of corn have
been applied. Following this analysis, research was conducted to
answer the following question: is it possible to enhance corn price
forecasts considering the influence of rainfall precipitation?
